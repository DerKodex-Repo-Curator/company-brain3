# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

> _v0.4.0 scaffold — full implementation pending in v1.x. Adopters: fill in the placeholders below and re-run `cb render`._

## 1. Scope

_[Adopters: 1–2 paragraphs. What software does this specify?]_

## 2. Software architecture overview

_[Adopters: 2–3 paragraphs describing major components and their interactions.]_

## 3. Functional requirements (software class)

_No software-class requirements captured. Run `intake` and add requirement nodes with `requirement_class: software`._

## 4. Non-functional requirements

_[Adopters: performance, security, observability, accessibility, internationalization, supportability.]_

## 5. External interfaces

_[Adopters: APIs consumed, APIs produced, file formats, protocols.]_

## 6. Features in scope

- [feature-continuous-ecg-recording] **Feature: Continuous Dual-Channel ECG Recording** — Vitalisens Cardio continuously records dual-channel ECG throughout the monitoring window, with motion artifact rejection via accelerometer.
- [feature-pad-quick-replace] **Feature: Pad Quick-Replace** — Snap-fit pad interface with orientation cues and electronic step-by-step instructions; supports self-service replacement in under 5 minutes.


## 8. Software-specific risks

- [risk-insight-pad-adhesion-failure-affects-data-quality] **Risk Insight: Pad Adhesion Failure Cascades into Data-Quality Failure** — Pad adhesion failure does not just lose signal — it tends to fail silently, producing noisy data that looks plausible. Detection matters as much as prevention.

## Traceability

_[Adopters: trace each software requirement back to a system requirement and forward to a test case.]_
