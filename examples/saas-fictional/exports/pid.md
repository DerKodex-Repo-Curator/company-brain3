> _v0.4.0 scaffold — full implementation pending in v1.x. Adopters: fill in the placeholders below and re-run `cb render`._

## 1. Purpose

_[Adopters: state the project's purpose in 1–2 sentences. The pillars below should anchor it.]_

Governing pillars:
- [pillar-icp-vpe-scaling-saas] **ICP: VPE at Scaling B2B SaaS (50–250 Engineers)** — Loftwing serves VPs of Engineering and CTOs at B2B SaaS companies between Series A and Series C (roughly 50–250 engineers).
- [pillar-no-consumer-market] **Non-Goal: No Consumer Market** — Loftwing is and remains a B2B SaaS product sold to companies. We do not sell to individual developers, indie hackers, or consumers.
- [pillar-no-developer-surveillance] **Non-Goal: No Developer Surveillance** — Loftwing will never ship features that score, rank, or surveil individual contributors. The smallest unit of analysis we expose is the team.
- [pillar-self-serve-over-enterprise-sales] **Self-Serve Setup Over Enterprise Sales Motion** — A new user must be able to connect Loftwing to their stack and see the first dashboard in under 10 minutes, without talking to sales.
- [pillar-team-level-signal] **Team-Level Signal Over Individual-Contributor Metrics** — Every Loftwing metric and dashboard view is scoped to the team or higher; we do not surface or score individual contributors.

## 2. Scope

_[Adopters: define in-scope and out-of-scope. Reference any non-goal pillars from the decision-log section below.]_

Products in scope:
- [product-loftwing-insights] **Loftwing Insights** — The flagship product: a dashboard surface for VPEs that aggregates GitHub + Linear/Jira data into team-level cycle time, deploy frequency, and planning accuracy views.

## 3. Key stakeholders

- [stakeholder-founders] **Stakeholder: Founders (CEO/product + CTO/engineering)** — Two-founder team. CEO owns product, GTM, and the customer-research function. CTO owns engineering, infrastructure, and integrations.

## 4. Success criteria

_[Adopters: list 3–5 measurable success criteria. Tie each to a decision or a pillar.]_

Decisions on file that shape success criteria:
- [decision-001-plg-first-not-enterprise] **Decision 001: PLG-First, Not Enterprise Sales** — Loftwing's GTM motion is product-led growth (self-serve signup, in-product activation, in-product upgrade) — not enterprise sales with demos and procurement cycles.
- [decision-002-three-integrations-only-in-v1] **Decision 002: Three Integrations Only in v1 (GitHub, Linear, Jira)** — Loftwing v1 ships with exactly three integrations: GitHub, Linear, and Jira. No GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or other issue trackers until v2.
- [decision-003-workspace-pricing-not-seat-based] **Decision 003: Workspace-Based Pricing, Not Per-Seat** — Loftwing prices per workspace (per company), not per developer seat. Three workspace tiers; no per-seat scaling.

## 5. Risks

_No risk-insights captured. Run `intake risk` for ISO 14971-vocabulary risk thinking (medical-device profile)._

## 6. Milestones

_[Adopters: outline 3–6 milestones with target dates. v0.4.0 has no milestone node type; lessons-learned and project-charter cover related lifecycle data.]_
