# company-brain — Roadmap

Relative milestones, not dated. Each milestone is a coherent, shippable increment. The [PRD](PRD.md) is the source of truth for scope detail; this doc is the source of truth for sequencing.

Dates can be layered on later once the project owner has a sense of velocity. Order is non-negotiable for the v0.x milestones — each one depends on the previous.

---

## v0.1.0 — Schema and architect (foundation)

**Why first:** every other workstream depends on the schema being correct and the example vault being legible.

**Included:**
- Schema definitions in `src/company_brain/schema/`: node types, edge types, frontmatter, profile mechanism.
- `vault-architect` skill + `cb scaffold` — creates a valid empty vault for a given profile, including `_system/`, `entities/`, `risk/` (medical-device), `_attachments/`, `_branding/`, `exports/`. Runs `git init` and creates the initial commit by default (`--no-git` to opt out). Writes a vault-level `.gitignore` matched to the schema (notably gitignoring `_system/INDEX.md` since it's regenerated per intake).
- `examples/meddev-fictional/` hand-built — patient monitoring wearable + replaceable sensor pad. Includes a competitor with two-version IFU history, a `regulatory-clearance` with predicate edges, a `web-snapshot` source with an attached PNG, decisions with `## What This Rules Out`, pillars-as-non-goals, and vision-source nodes.
- `cb validate` CLI — exits clean on the example vault.
- Repo created **public** at `github.com/nemock/company-brain` with `README.md` skeleton, `LICENSE` (MIT), `pyproject.toml`, `docs/controlled-document-boundary.md`, `docs/vault-as-git-repository.md`. Public from day one — every v0.x commit is visible. The README's top line states this is pre-1.0 and under active development.

**Unlocks:** the schema is grounded in real-looking nodes and machine-validated. All downstream skills can target a known-good shape.

**Done when:** `cb validate examples/meddev-fictional/` exits 0 and the example reads naturally to a med-device engineer.

---

## v0.2.0 — Intake (vision, product, competitor)

**Why next:** the most differentiated parts of the project (vision capture, competitor archive) need to exist before doc generation has anything interesting to render.

**Included:**
- `intake` skill with `vision` sub-mode (six-phase flow, batched-table review, `--interactive` flag).
- `intake` skill with `product` sub-mode.
- `intake` skill with `competitor`, `competitor-ifu`, `competitor-clearance`, `competitor-snapshot` (manual screenshot import path).
- `atomize` skill — markdown, Word, PDF.
- `atomize` skill — transcripts and image screenshots (Claude vision for text extraction from images).
- **Schema bump**: extend `requirement_class` to accept `software` and `hardware` alongside `market` / `user` / `system`. Enables SRS and HRS generators downstream. (Small change; existing nodes stay valid. _Already implemented on main as part of the doc-scope expansion work; this milestone formalizes it._)

**Unlocks:** users can start populating real vaults. The pilot company can begin ingesting existing project initiation documents and the messy product launch outline.

**Done when:** a 5-minute messy dictated input produces a useful set of typed nodes for review, and atomizing a Word PID produces correctly-typed requirement / stakeholder / decision nodes.

---

## v0.3.0 — Query, MRD, and one-pager

**Why next:** completes the round trip from intake to artifact. This is the milestone where company-brain proves its core value, and where the doc-generation framework is exercised by two finished docs of different size.

**Included:**
- `query` skill — IB retrieval analyst, profile-aware, walks edges, cites node ids.
- `doc-generate` skill with the full **MRD** pipeline:
  - Profile-aware section inclusion (medical-device-only sections omitted entirely for other profiles).
  - Evidence-vs-vision split.
  - Anti-decisions / non-goal section.
  - IFU comparison table (medical-device profile).
  - Source bibliography with `source_kind` labels.
- `doc-generate` skill with the full **one-pager** pipeline — a much shorter document that proves the framework is general, not MRD-specific.
- Branding integration: doc-generate reads `_branding/colors.yaml`, optional `logo.png`, optional `templates/` overrides.
- Output to markdown, docx, html.

**Unlocks:** the public-facing value proposition becomes real. From here, every demo can include "and now generate the MRD and the one-pager."

**Done when:** the meddev-fictional vault produces an MRD that labels every claim by source-kind, includes the IFU comparison and anti-decision sections, and re-runs idempotently. The vault also produces a 1-page summary suitable as a sales leave-behind.

---

## v0.4.0 — Visualize, maintain, and the 19 doc scaffolds

**Why next:** long-term vault health, and the signal that doc-generate is a broad category — 19 scaffolded generators across project management, engineering requirements, strategy, sales, and external comms.

**Included:**
- `visualize` skill + `cb viewer` — D3 HTML, IFU chain view, predicate tree view, community detection.
- `maintain` skill — confidence decay (fact nodes linked to medium/high volatility metrics), audit, broken-edge repair, missing-inverse-edge auto-fix, INDEX.md drift repair.
- `cb validate --fix` implemented.
- `doc-generate` scaffolds for all **19** remaining doc types (see PRD §11 for the full table):
  - **Project management (PMBOK-aligned, abbreviated):** PID, project charter, stakeholder register, risk register (medical-device), status report, meeting minutes (1 page, not 12), lessons learned.
  - **Engineering requirements:** SRD, SRS, HRS.
  - **Strategy / sales / external:** business plan, sales battle card (one file per competitor), competitive brief, IFU comparison report (medical-device), decision log, press release, investor update, onboarding doc.
  - **Risk (medical-device):** risk brainstorm.

**Unlocks:** users have a long-term answer to "is my vault healthy?" and every adopter can see scaffolds for the documents they're likely to want — even if the full implementations aren't done.

**Done when:** `cb validate --fix` repairs synthetic damage to the example vault, and each of the 19 scaffold generators produces a skeleton output (flagged as `scaffold`) for the meddev-fictional vault that adopters can fill in.

---

## v0.5.0 — Second example + polish

**Why next:** profile mechanism only earns trust when it's exercised by two profiles. Polish closes the gap to public release.

**Included:**
- `examples/saas-fictional/` — hand-built using a different profile (likely the `default` industry-agnostic profile to start; `saas` profile content slots stay reserved until v1.x).
- Complete documentation: `README.md`, `docs/adoption-guide.md`, `docs/competitive-archive.md`, `docs/profiles.md`, `docs/schema.md`.
- Fresh-user onboarding test: a user who has never seen the project should be able to install, scaffold, do a 30-minute intake, and generate an MRD without help.
- `CHANGELOG.md` covering v0.1.0 through v0.5.0.

**Unlocks:** public release readiness.

**Done when:** a person who has never seen the project completes the onboarding flow end-to-end and the resulting vault validates cleanly.

---

## v0.6.0 — Field-report polish (out-of-band)

**Status:** ✅ shipped 2026-05-25. Driven by operating the production `AiM_Wiki` vault, not by the planned milestone sequence — five friction points surfaced and fixed before v1.0.0. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full delta.

---

## v0.7.0 — Document-driven intake (out-of-band)

**Status:** ✅ shipped 2026-05-26. Surfaced during a design conversation about making the MRD section structure drive what gets captured, rather than figuring out which intake sub-mode covers each piece. Manifest-driven; first manifest covers the MRD; more arrive as adopters need them. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full delta.

---

## v0.8.0 — Primary-entity marking (out-of-band)

**Status:** ✅ shipped 2026-05-27. Surfaced during meta-vault dogfooding: the doc-generators picked the wrong representative entity whenever a vault had more than one persona, product, or competitor named semantically rather than by priority prefix (the MRD listed personas as Founder → Lead Marketing → Lead Product because `lead-m` < `lead-p` alphabetically). Adds an optional `primary: bool` to base frontmatter, scoped per `(type, namespace)`; five generators filter by it before falling back to alphabetical with a footer note. `cb validate --strict` warns on multiple primaries in the same scope and on rendered exports with no primary marked. Source spec: [`docs/specs/spec-primary-entity-marking.md`](docs/specs/spec-primary-entity-marking.md). See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full delta.

---

## v0.8.1 — Branding logo embedding (out-of-band)

**Status:** ✅ shipped 2026-06-01. Closes the gap between "`_branding/logo.png` is detected by the loader" (true since v0.3.0) and "the logo actually appears in rendered output" (was not implemented). The docx writer now inserts a centered logo at the top of the document; the HTML wrapper inlines a base64 data URL so the rendered HTML stays self-contained. Surfaced during the Panda Surgical public-research dogfood — branded colors landed correctly, the logo file did not. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full delta.

---

## v1.0.0 — Release tag and announcement

**Included:**
- Tag `v1.0.0` on `github.com/nemock/company-brain` (the repo has been public since v0.1.0; this is the release moment, not the publication moment).
- Public announcement (channel TBD — likely a short post on the project owner's blog or LinkedIn, possibly Show HN, possibly the AI Impact Skool community).
- Two-week listening window before starting v1.x work — early-adopter feedback shapes priorities.

**Done when:** the `v1.0.0` tag is published, the README leads with a clear value prop and a 5-minute quickstart, and at least one external user has run the full pipeline end-to-end.

---

## v1.x — Automation and depth

Order within v1.x is flexible; prioritized by user feedback after v1.0.0.

**Capture automation:**
- chrome-devtools-mcp-assisted `competitor-snapshot` — full-page screenshot via CDP, DOM text via `evaluate_script`, optional network-request manifest as a sibling source node.
- openFDA API integration: `cb intake-510k <K-number>` pulls structured fields and optionally the summary PDF.
- Multi-page crawl + change detection (snapshot diffing).
- Polite single-page HTTP fallback (`cb fetch`) — for users who haven't installed chrome-devtools-mcp. Uses `httpx` + a text-extraction library; respects robots.txt and rate limits; fails clearly on JS-heavy sites and tells the user to fall back to manual import or chrome-devtools-mcp.
- **`intake bootstrap` sub-mode** — guided first-run interview aimed at empty vaults and pre-founders. A short ordered question set ("What's the product idea, in one paragraph?", "Who is it for, even roughly?", "What problem does it solve?", "What stage are you at?", "What's already in your head — want to dictate?") that lowers the on-ramp below `intake vision`. Accepts a free-text brain dump as an alternative seed via the existing `atomize` path, so a 3000-word voice memo can bootstrap the typed graph without a Q&A session. The components exist today; this packages them as one named flow for the solopreneur persona.

**Format breadth:**
- PowerPoint atomization (`python-pptx`).

**Doc generators (full implementations to replace scaffolds):**
- All 19 scaffolded generators get full implementations in v1.x, prioritized by user feedback after v1.0.0.
- Likely priority order based on the data the meddev-fictional vault already exercises: **IFU comparison report**, **sales battle card**, **decision log**, **SRD**, **PID**, **status report** — these have the richest data on tap. Lower-priority based on data needs: **investor update** (needs metric snapshots that adopters may not have yet), **lessons learned** (needs project-close patterns), **business plan** (needs much broader vault content).
- Final priority order determined by adopter demand after v1.0.0.

**Integration:**
- Wrapper around the existing `competitor-profiling` skill that writes directly into the vault rather than emitting a standalone markdown file.

**Done when:** the chrome-devtools-mcp path is the documented happy path for competitor capture, all four scaffolded generators are fully implemented, and openFDA ingestion handles a 510(k) with no manual intervention.

---

## v2 — BOM and beyond

The features held back because v1 didn't need them and they would have widened the schema before it was stable.

**BOM and components:**
- `component`, `kit`, `bom-item` node types as first-class.
- **Quantity-bearing `part_of` edges** — the edge schema extension that v1 deliberately avoided.
- Sub-component hierarchy via recursive `part_of`.
- Cross-kit overlap analytics: `cb analyze --components` lists shared components, kits affected by a change, BOM rollup costs.
- Component dependency reasoning queries: "If we deprecate component X, which kits and products are affected, and what are their risk insights?"

**Monitoring:**
- Recurring competitor snapshot jobs ("re-scan these 8 competitors monthly").
- IFU drift alerting.
- Press-release topic clustering across the snapshot corpus.

**Capture without chrome-devtools-mcp:**
- Headless-browser fetcher for users who haven't installed chrome-devtools-mcp.

**Ecosystem:**
- Optional MCP server exposing the vault as a queryable resource for other agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

**Probably not needed (revisit only on adopter demand):**
- Confluence / Notion / Obsidian Sync export adapters. The git-push delivery model (GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / on-prem) covers the "publish into existing tooling" use case for most teams without a dedicated adapter.

**Profile content:**
- SaaS, hardware, services profile node types and intake sub-modes fleshed out.

---

## Sequencing rules

- **Each v0.x milestone gates the next.** No parallelization until v1.0.0 ships. A small project shipping in order is easier to reason about than a large project shipping in parallel.
- **Within a milestone, build example-vault content before validating in code.** Schema mistakes are cheaper to find by writing real-looking nodes than by writing tests against a hypothetical schema.
- **The [PRD §17 build order](PRD.md) is the canonical step sequence within v1.0.0.** This roadmap aggregates those steps into shippable releases; the PRD is the authority on what each step contains.
- **v1.x and v2 reorder freely** based on user feedback after public release. The lists above are not in priority order.
